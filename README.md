This is the demo / interview test/assignment for MixFit Lausanne, completed in the summer of 2019. The task description was as follows:

# TASK DESCRIPTION
We'd like to ask you to design a system in rails with the following use cases:

As a postman user I can submit my height and weight in the database
As a postman user I can enter my food intake for a specific day, represented by an amount (4 to 10) of Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 and Iron in the database
As a postman user I can enter my activity level, represented by a negative amount (1 to 3) of Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 and Iron in the database
As a postman user I can make a request so that I can get a personalized recipe based on the above values (check formula below)
As another postman user I make the same request and have another result based on my personal values
As a postman user I can see my personal recipes that have been generated, day by day

Assumptions:
- At the beginning of the day, all 3 values are 0.
- We eat, then make the activity.
- At the end of the day, all 3 values must be 10.

The formula
- The formula should take my values of Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 and Iron after I've eaten.
- It should subtract the activity level values from it.
- It should then complete that result to the total of 10/10.
- The output recipe should be the value that has been added in order to reach 10.

Example: if I have:
5/10 in Vitamin C and my activity reduced it by 3,
7/10 in Vitamin D3 and my activity reduced it by 2,
4/10 in Iron and my activity reduced it by 1,

the output should show:
Vitamin C 8 (current level is 5-3 = 2)
Vitamin D3 5 (current level is 7-2 = 5)
Iron 7 (current level is 4-1 = 3)

You don't have to design front end code, or provide authentication. Let's assume people identify themselves with a username, no password, no access restrictions etc. basically as simple as needed.

The code can be hosted in a Github or bitbucket repo as you prefer.
